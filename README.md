### Info

It's my sync-only (non-async) fork of the older version of [VRCpy](https://github.com/vrchatapi/VRChatPython/).


### Installation

Since it's not on PyPI, if you wish to use it, you have to install it manually.

1. If you have the regular vrcpy installed, uninstall it: `python -m pip uninstall vrcpy`
2. Clone this repo somewhere safe.
3. Install it from that place like `python -m pip install -e VRChatPython`

To upgrade, just pull changes via git.

Avoid upgrading this package in pip because that will replace it with the Katistic's version.

PS: If anyone knows how to mark it as unupgradeable via pip, please let me know.
